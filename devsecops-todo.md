- [ ] Software Factory
    - [ ] App Release Automation
        - requirements / guidelines:
            - Local & Remote Pairity (i.e. platform independent)
            - SLSA Level 3 (hardened, provenance, signed, trusted)
            - Reproducible / Bootstrapable Builds (hermetic, ideally bit-for-bit reproducible)
            - DoD DevSecOps Reference Design / Ironbank
            - OpenSSF Scorecards + Dependabot
            - something like: wolfi + wolfictl + melange + apko + earthly (but that actually works together from source...)
        - checks: formatter, linters, static analyzers
        - version checker: app, deps, langs, os, pkgs, tools
        - add automation-related artifacts:
            - release artifacts: image, archive, sbom, provenance
            - version bump
            - test artifacts (e.g. previous performance results)
        - audits: deps, licenses, secrets, sast, dast, rasp, vuln-scans, attestations, sbom, provenance, verify-attestations
        - policy enforcement: oscap?
        - tests: property-based, trace-based, coverage, benchmarks, mutation, contracts, automated-canary-analysis
        - service registry/catalog
    - [ ] Platform Release Automation (i.e. Erlang & Elixir)
    - [ ] OS Release Automation

    - Operator Framework: Level 5
    - Observability Maturity Model Level 3+
- [ ] Automated Moving Target Defense
    - Polymorphic OS & Platform Build Pipelines
